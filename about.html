                        Welcome to my portfolio! Growing up I always had a creative passion and I love 
                        building things working with my hands also learning new things. I love the outdoors
                        and the indoors when the outdoors isn’t looking so pretty. Born October 23rd, 1997, 
                        in Peterborough, Ontario with a perspective of a Scorpio I had some trouble learning 
                        the hard way, but I find learning the hard way is the best way because that gives you 
                        the truth. I see truth brings hard work. I always had a vision for more or big but to 
                        this day I still struggle with figuring that out exactly. For the last 5 months, I've 
                        built myself an online reputation on mostly TikTok of my hometown (Peterborough). <br> 
                        <br> It 
                        started off with just boredom and it's funny to think about how many cool interests and 
                        facts my hometown had and seemed to me no one else knew about. I've been posting 2 to 3 
                        times weekly since and I'm on the track to getting 8,000 followers! It’s been a journey 
                        so far meeting people here in Ottawa who've recognized me. People tell me all the time 
                        they love my videos. It’s a great conversation starter, I think. But it also gives me 
                        content creator experience which I can’t complain about. <br> 
                        <br> I work security and if you 
                        have worked security, you know how much free time you have when you work these types 
                        of shifts. I also have gotten into reading and listening to podcasts because I find 
                        it more entertaining than watching pointless shows all the time and not learning 
                        anything valuable. We as humans waste so much time choosing pleasure over the 
                        practice. My goal for myself is to one day bring an impact to the world, I don’t 
                        know what it is yet or how I will do it, but I can feel in myself that it will happen. 
                        I believe in kindness and empathy, loyalty, respect, protection, and providing.
